# Hardware Setup

## Computer

We use a Mid-2012 MacBook Pro Retina as our primary (and currently only) computer. This computer has enough connectivity built in to connect to up to three external displays and supports the Midi features of ProPresenter. We also use this computer for recording audio and plan to use it in the future for controlling lights and streaming services to the Internet.
