# Software Setup

We use ProPresenter (slides and media), Lightkey (stage lights), Reaper (audio
recording, backing tracks, and drum sounds), Wirecast (live streaming and video
recording), and Audio Hijack (audio routing).

Make sure Lightkey is launched first since it creates its own virtual MIDI port
which Reaper and ProPresenter need to be able to send commands to.

Make sure the Qu-32 is plugged in and powered on before starting reaper. If the
Qu-32 is ever powered off while plugged in you will need to restart Reaper.

Make sure all of the displays (TV, projector, and live stream monitor) are
plugged in before starting ProPresenter.

Audio Hijack can either be started after ProPresenter is launched, or it can
launch ProPresenter itself. In any case, when you launch Audio Hijack simply
start the ProPresenter session and make sure the audio is being routed to the
OWC dock. Make sure the OWC dock is plugged in before launching Audio Hijack.

Make sure all video hardware is plugged in before starting Wirecast.
