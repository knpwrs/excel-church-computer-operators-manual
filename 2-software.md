# Software Setup

We use ProPresenter (slides and media), Lightkey (stage lights), Reaper (audio
recording, backing tracks, and drum sounds), and Wirecast (live streaming and
video recording).

Make sure Lightkey is launched first since it creates its own virtual MIDI port
which Reaper and ProPresenter need to be able to send commands to.

Make sure the Qu-32 is plugged in and powered on before starting reaper. If the
Qu-32 is ever powered off while plugged in you will need to restart Reaper.

Make sure all of the displays (TV, projector, and live stream monitor) are
plugged in before starting ProPresenter.

Make sure all video hardware is plugged in before starting Wirecast.
