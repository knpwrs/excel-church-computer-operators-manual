# Software Setup

We use ProPresenter (slides and media), Lightkey (stage lights), Reaper
(backing tracks and drum sounds), and Audio Hijack (audio routing).

## Audio Hijack

We use Audio Hijack to capture the audio from the master instance of
ProPresenter and output it directly to the audio mixer over USB. Audio Hijack
can either be started after ProPresenter is launched, or it can launch
ProPresenter itself.  In any case, when you launch Audio Hijack simply start
the ProPresenter session and make sure the audio is being routed to the mixer.
The mixer should be plugged in and powered on before starting Audio Hijack.
